Future mobility apillar camera image processing technology

In the information age, the proliferation of new technologies has always resulted in the expansion of pending throughput and processing speed. For example, the description of computers involves the expansion of information storage, throughput, and processing speed. What's more, 'big data' is also due to expanded amounts of information. Currently, we are leading the new era of artificial intelligence, and multiple artificial intelligences such as Chat GPT and assistive devices are providing help to us in various fields.

Before thinking about ‘what technology will emerge in the future,’ we were able to establish the background that information processing will be further maximized in the future. I thought that eventually everything would be converted into data and stored, and there would come a time when all information about each person in the world would be accessible, and the processing speed would be very fast.

A program that measures the distance of an object using a single camera was demonstrated using opencv. In an era where everything is dataized and information about every individual is accessible, if an object is recognized with a single camera, it can connect to the object without any other sensor through information about the object (size, height, etc.) and object information received from outside. I thought it might be possible to measure distance. In the demonstration, the object's original face size is stored as built-in information, and the object's distance is found by comparing it with the object's face size received by the camera.

Additionally, using yolo, we demonstrated a system that recognizes and reports the type of object using a single camera.
